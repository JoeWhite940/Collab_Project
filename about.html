					<h1>Victoria Hart, A living legend</h1>
				</div>
				<div class="panel-body">
					<p> I am Victoria Silver Heart, an astounding woman renowned as an: actress, model, presenter, wine connoisseur, professor of the arts, gay supporter, jockey, journalist, professional cage fighter, firewoman, arachnophobia ambassador, stylist, photographer, chef, director, I.T. engineer, writer, advertiser, carpenter, designer, hairdresser, musician, florist, make up artist, nanny, driver, accountant, dentist, librarian, architect, scientist, and pilot, among other things. Mainly working in the South East, England. </p>
					<br>
					<p> When thinking about how to sum myself up in a few sentences, I'm drawn upon a quote I once heard from my mate “from great power, comes great responsibility”. I feel this really sums up my life. The talents that have been blessed upon me are a great and vast, it is my responsibility to show them to the people of the world. Let me share with you my journey of how I got here. </p>
					<br>
					<p>To start I was raised in the South East of England. Born to devoted and caring parents, my father was the priest in our local village, a hero amongst our community to which I proudly followed in his footsteps but through the form of performance. My mother a postwoman, providing a vital role within our town such as delivering important information, a skill I have used many a time throughout my career, but this time helping the world by supplying advice and support to anyone, but most importantly to my fans. I was raised a single child but proud to say I possess no stereotypical characteristics of a spoilt, rich daughter, people often commend me on my modesty. I believe the reason my childhood was so spectacular was due to my popularity throughout school life. I was constantly surrounded by friends who were essentially my brothers and sisters. </p>
					<br>
					<p>In adult life I maintained the same attitude and my popularity only grew. I'm a great people person; I have been blessed with a very witty and fun personality that was instilled in me from a young age, making people naturally want to be in my company. At this moment in my life I feel I should focus on yours truly, it’s a dog eat dog world out there so you've got to look out for number one so that’s why I choose to focus on my career instead of relationships, even though it is likely that I may have missed out on meeting my true Prince Charming. I don’t like clichés as I believe I am a unique individual, therefore I will say that I strive to be the best that I can be, as there is nothing more you can do but do your best.</p>
					<br>
					<p>I am a self-taught performer with only little training in my local village hall, but sometimes talent is just instilled in individuals at birth and I am so grateful that I was a chosen one. My combination of acting, singing and dancing allowed me to shine above the other 6 performers in our village hall performances. And now to tell you about my big break, whilst accidently walking into an Abercrombie and Fitch casting, my charismatic personality and naturally high cheek bones got me my first modelling job for Clarks, and the rest is history as they say! Now a regular appearance on TV, you’ve probably seen me on channel 536’s Weather TV, secret agent programmes and even presenting my own show, Curtains Curtains, Curtains, etc. Next stop for me… Hollywood!</p>
